## ADR-0001: Local Source of Truth, VM Runtime Executor

- Decision: keep all source edits, docs, commits, and pushes local; run dependencies, tests, Docker, data, training, Terraform, and `gcloud` on `lfm`.
- Rationale: the local machine is constrained, while the VM has appropriate CPU, memory, disk, Docker, and cloud network context.
- Consequence: every verification command must be preceded by `scripts/remote/sync_to_vm.sh` or by resetting the VM clone to the pushed feature branch.

## ADR-0002: Sentinel-Guarded Remote Workspace

- Decision: use only `/home/ducan/credit-mlops-codex` with `.codex_remote_workspace`.
- Rationale: prevents accidental modification or deletion of unrelated VM projects.
- Consequence: sync/reset scripts refuse unsafe paths.
